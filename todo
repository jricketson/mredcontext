refactor to use command pattern.
 -- Make each feature self contained.

filefinder needs to respond to cursor
keyboard shortcuts for:
 
  close
  make wider/narrower
  make longer/shorter
  move up/down/left/right

html filetype is not rendering

change font size (per editor?)
allow open in a directory <-- not possible until implemented by nw
navigation overview in panel at top

GOTO SYMBOL <-- this is the point
  find all definitions in a list (like the file finder) and allow user to choose
  go to line


LATER
ignore things that are gitignored

implement testing framework <-- not possible until can open other endpoints as implemented by nw
move editorpane to plugin

html filetype is not rendering

NAVIGATION
  make canvas zoomable
  user can click on overview to recenter
  user can label a section of canvas in the overview

EDITORS
  editors should stay out of each others way
  allow user to choose the file type/syntax
  change font size (per editor?)

NOTES
  user can create a note and attach to the canvas

watch files for changes on disk
  - new files/directories
  - updates to loaded files
  - deleted files/directories

GOTO SYMBOL
  arrange matches nearer the selection
  the new editor should show up next to the selection

BUG
  the configuration had an extra curly... I think that maybe the config writer should have a lock.

LATER
ignore things that are gitignored

NOTES:
wc: find . -regex ".*\(coffee\|main.js\|style.sass\)" -not -ipath "*node_modules*" | xargs wc -l | sort -n

filefinder needs to respond to cursor
keyboard shortcuts for:
 
  close
  make wider/narrower
  make longer/shorter
  move up/down/left/right

html filetype is not rendering

change font size (per editor?)
allow open in a directory <-- not possible until implemented by nw

GOTO SYMBOL
  find all definitions in a list (like the file finder) and allow user to choose

NAVIGATION
  navigation overview in panel at top
  user can drag the canvas
  make canvas zoomable
  user can click on overview to recenter

EDITORS
  editors should stay out of each others way
  many editors for the same file should update each other

NOTES
  user can create a note and attach to the canvas

watch files for changes on disk
  - new files/directories
  - updates to loaded files
  - deleted files/directories

BUG
  the configuration had an extra curly... I think that maybe the config writer should have a lock.

LATER
ignore things that are gitignored
